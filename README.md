meta-cryptocurrency
==============

This is a Yocto/OpenEmbedded meta-layer for cryptocurrency related packages. Such as cgminer, cpuminer and more! This creates an all in one crypto Yocto distro for any device.

Support for Raspberry PIs, including WiFi support on RPI0 and RPI3. 

Dubbed as hodlOS, with plans to release a mini-distro and expose the packages using apt-get through a CDN. With original reference to the legendary cryto term [HODL](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0). Happy mining & HODL'ing!

Download
========
Planning to make pre-build releases for RPIs soon. First need to get the distro right.

Build
=====

#### Basic Yocto build instructions for RPI

Clone this repo and the following dependencies:
 * [Meta-openembedded](https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded)
 * [Poky](https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/)
 * [Meta-raspberrypi](https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi/) If you're building for RPI, add your BSP of choice here

Initiate OE by invoking the oe init script:

`$ source poky/oe-init-build-env rpi-ml-build`

Add bb layers:

```
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-oe
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-python
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-multimedia
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-networking
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-raspberrypi
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-cryptocurrency
```

Edit `conf/local.conf` and set the target machine:
`MACHINE = "raspberrypi3"`

*OR* To the target machine you're looking to build.

Build the image with
```
bitbake hodl-image
```

Or if you're looking to build a wifi image (e.g. RPI3/RPI0 w/ WIFI):
```
bitbake hodl-wifi-image
```

*Note* you can set SSID = <ssid> and PSK = <psd> in your `conf\local.conf`


Usage instructions
==================

To flash the sdimg on the sd card:

`$ sudo dd if=tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3/miner-image-raspberrypi3.rpi-sdimg of=/dev/sdX`

Boot your RPI.

See individual miner/wallet website for instructions on how to use the individual packages.
